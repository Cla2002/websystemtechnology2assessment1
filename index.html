            <h2>REPUBLIC ACT 10630</h2>
           <p> An act strengthening the juvenile justice system in the Philippines, Amending for the purpose 
        for the purpose republic act no. 9344, otherwise justice and welfare act of 2006 and appropriating funds therefor 
    Be it enacted by Senate and Houe of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled. <br>
    <br>
    Republic Act No. 9344, one bill passed into law, institutionalized the promotion of the well-being of child and their families, involvement of parents and guarfians, promotion of diversion, avoiding deprivation of liberty and protecting thr privacy rights of children. <br>
    <br>
    Republic Act No. 10630 further emphasized child-sensitive justice policies focused on the best interest of the child. This principle has been first laid down in the Doha Declaration. <br>
<br>
    Before Republic Act No. 9344 was enacted, children at risk and CICL were treated much like adult offenders as when former President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. signed the law Judiciary Reorganization Act 1980.
    Which abolished the juvenile and domestic relations courts. As such offenders were subjected to the same adversarial proceedings as their adult </p>

            <br> 
            <h5>
                defines the juvenile and Welfare System as a system dealing with children at risk and children in conflict with the law which provides child-appropriate proceedings, including programmes and services for prevention, diversion, rehabilitation, re-integration and aftercare to ensure their normal growth and development. <br>
               <br>
                Under republic Act 10630, offences which only apply to a child and not to adult are called "Status Offences" <br>

        <h5>
            "Child in Conflict with the Law" or CICL on the other hand refers to a child who is alleged as, accused of, or adjudged as, having comitted an offence under Philippine Law. <br>
            <br>
            A child can commit an act or omission whether punishable under special laws or the amended Revised Penal Code which is refereed to as an "offence" <br>

            <h4 class="headings"></h4>
            <h5> <p> In the Philippines, members of Congress had passed bills intended make laws more consistent with the Philippines' advocacy on juvenile justice. 
                <br> 
                <br> As much as the Philippines should be concerned with a juvinile justice system in harmony with international policies, the dominant goal is to achieve a standard national policy on CICL rather tahn an accurate reproduction of an international model on CICL <br>
            <br>
            As an offshoot of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) the R.A. No. 9344 intends to deal with these children without resorting to judicial proceedings. Instead of punishing juvenile offenders and treating them criminals, these child offenders will be provided by the State and the community with assistance to prevent them from comitting future offenses.</p></h5>
